The Advanced Encryption Standard is a pre-quantum encryption. The alternative term Rijndael-Algorithmu comes from its developers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen who propsed it 2000.

This tool is only to play around with the differnent modes and parameters.
For serious cryptography you would need a true random number generator.

All examples will be saved in the folder AES_log_files.
